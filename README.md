## React Component Lifecycle Stages

- **Mount**: Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
- **Update**: A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
- **Unmount**: When a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

## Methods in Lifecycle Components

- **render()**: Used for rendering HTML to the DOM.
- **componentDidMount()**: Called after the components are mounted in the DOM.
- **componentDidUpdate()**: Called after the components are updated and rendered in the DOM.
- **componentWillUnmount()**: Called before the components are removed from the DOM.
